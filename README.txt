The PartyPredict jupyter notebook is part of an independent project I conducted while teaching myself about NLP and machine learning. 

The goal of this project was to create a model that could predict the political party of a presidential candidate based on their language use. The data consists of 17 presidential debates and 17 state of the union addresses. The utterances of democratic politicans are in the dem.txt file. The utterances of republican politicians are in the repub.txt file. This project is inherently limited due to the small size of the dataset.  

My main objective was to familiarize myself with NLP techniques for machine learning. I practiced data preprocessing, tokenization, word vectorization, embedding, and two strategies for building a neural network model. I also experimented with hyperparameters such as the batch size, epochs, learning rate, and neural network architecture. 

The partypredict notebook, although I did not generate a high-performance model, showcases many of the skills I learned and the techniques I can implement.
